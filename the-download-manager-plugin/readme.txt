This plugin was originally developed by an external agency.

after the initial release I then developed all of the new features into the plugin such as the ability to hide downloads behind a request and approval system before granting access to the package, along with conditions that trigger different types of contents depneding on what type of download it is and whether it related to the university programme or not.

Again, some of the features need the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to show up and work, such as the options via form input types in the admin when creating a download package.

Also worth noting that we were using a theme that incorporated Bootstrap at the time, so many of the CSS classes are Bootstrap classes for quicker styling.
