This plugin was originally developed by an external agency.

after the initial release I then developed all of the new features into the plugin such as the ability to hide downloads behind a request and approval system before granting access to the package, along with conditions that trigger different types of contents depneding on what type of download it is and whether it related to the university programme or not.
