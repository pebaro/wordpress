This plugin was written to extend the functionality of the Elementor page builder for WordPress.

I have a more recent version which I don't have access to on this machine, so this is the first release which is by no means finished.

what is in the first release are two extra widgets for the page builder that give a simple Modal widget with a preview written using BackboneJS template and then another custom widget that allows me to take the export from AnimateCC and generate the aninmation render within the WordPress page via the Elementor page builder.

I will be overwriting this plugin with the full version when I am back in the office.

The full version has 4 widgets under a custom section titled ImgTec in the side menu of options where you drag your elements onto the page when building/designing.
