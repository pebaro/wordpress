This plugin is for use with another custom plugin for managing our downloads, hence the admin will create sections in the menus and the admin page for the associated post types, taxonomies and data.

this is also a more recent version - originally I set up our three different types of event as one single custom post type, then use conditional logic in conjunction with Advanced Custom Fields data to render the correct part of the code on the correct page for the correct event type. I will put this code seperately so that you can compare.

This was my first custom plugin for WordPress that I did from scratch without using any kind of base to work from. It has evolved over time but in essense it is still pretty much the same in terms of functionality, it's just been refactored here and there.
